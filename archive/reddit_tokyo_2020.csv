""SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s Olympic committee said Saturday it removed banners at the Olympic athletes’ village in Tokyo that referred to a 16th-century war between Korea and Japan after the International Olympic Committee ruled they were provocative.

In agreeing to take down the banners, the South Koreans said they received a promise from the IOC that the displaying of the Japanese “rising sun” flag will be banned at stadiums and other Olympic venues. The flag, portraying a red sun with 16 rays extending outward, is resented by many people in South Korea and other parts of Asia who see it as a symbol of Japan’s wartime past.""

""South Korea’s Olympic Committee said it was told by the IOC that the banners invoked images of war and went against Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, which says “no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.”

The committee said it agreed to remove the banners after the IOC promised to also apply the same rules to the rising sun flags and ban them at all Olympic venues.""",2021-07-19 00:19:35

 If the Japanese Government were to restrict attendance, CoSport And the United States Olympic And Paralympic Committee (USOPC), would work with the Tokyo 2020 organizers to provide refunds for tickets – similar to what happened last Summer when refunds were offered at the time of the postponement. As an intermediary, CoSport passes customer payments for tickets to Tokyo 2020; therefore, the organizers would have to return those funds to CoSport so we could redistribute it to customers. A similar process would be involved for ticket and hotel packages, as CoSport also would work with hotels to refund moneys provided to reserve rooms. For these reasons, CoSport would be unable to provide an immediate refund, and attempts to obtain a refund directly from CoSport before these entities could provide the refunds to CoSport would be unsuccessful.",2021-03-15 17:59:31
Will Japan hold the Olympics?,1,lnkgzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tokyo2020/comments/lnkgzm/will_japan_hold_the_olympics/,1,1613753397.0,"Shimane Tatsuya, the governor of the western prefecture of Japan, Maruyama, recently announced his intention to call off the Olympic torch relay in the region. He explained his decision by the difficult state of affairs in Tokyo, which, he said, continues to be the main source of the spread of coronavirus infection, and the holding of such events can aggravate the situation all over the country.

It is worth noting that earlier the Japanese Minister for Administrative and Systemic Reform Taro Kono even allowed the cancellation of the Olympics. The reason was still called the same - COVID 19. However, is this so actually? Are the pragmatic Japanese, who today have managed to invest considerable funds in preparation for Tokyo 2020, allegedly due to coronavirus, will be able to abandon the Olympics, which are announced to be held without spectators?

Yes, they will be able. But it's not about coronavirus. In this case, the pragmatism of the Japanese lies not on the surface and is even more far-sighted than could be imagined.

The fact is that the relatively recent Prime Minister of Japan, E. Suga, inherited from his predecessor quite a lot of unresolved issues. There are territorial dispute with the PRC regarding the ownership of the Senkaku Islands (Chinese Diaoyuidao), Tokyo's continuing but unfounded claims to the Kuril Islands, economic recovery from the global pandemic and much more. In all these problems, Japan expects, and I must say sometimes receives, support from its Western ally - the United States.

The newly formed White House administration led by with Joe Biden, have repeatedly stated that their predecessors have taken insufficient measures to counter the spread of coronavirus infection, which resulted in a large number of victims in the country. The very day after the inauguration, Biden signed ten decrees that provide for tougher measures to combat with COVID-19. And of course, having thoroughly tried on the mask of the world hegemon, the United States will now do everything possible to ensure that other countries follow their example, primarily the allied countries.

Today, Biden's desire to antagonize Trump may cost many world athletes one of the most important events in their lives - the Tokyo Olympics. Fueling Hopes for United States\` support in solving its problems, Japan will do everything possible to please its trans-Pacific partner. In addition, they need to pay the debt for entering the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership - the economic brainchild of Beijing.

The best way for Tokyo to build long-term cooperation with Washington, is to demonstrate its subordination. And the cancellation of the Olympics under the pretext of a difficult situation with coronavirus can become a bargaining chip in bilateral relations.",2021-02-19 18:49:57

Farah uprooted himself from Britain, where he had been living since he was 8 years old, leaving his wife, Tania Nell and twin daughters, and moved to Kenya for a training camp in preparation for the London 2012 Summer Olympics.

“I could easily have stayed in the UK with my family in a nice house, but I was willing to take a risk,” he told RadioTimes. Though it was missing the comforts of his home and family, the training camp in Kenya enabled Farah to totally focus on his goal.

“My room is basic: a bed, no TV. I wake up, run, have breakfast, sleep, gym in the afternoon, another run in the evening,” he said, describing his daily routine in Kenya. “That’s it, nothing else. No going to the café, no going for coffee. I just eat, sleep and train. When you get out on the roads and trails, there are big groups of locals running everywhere. They all run with great hunger. They know if they don’t, their families don’t eat.”

The lifestyle change paid off. Farah captured four gold medals in total at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics, in the 5000 metres and 10,000 metres events, and has gone on to become one the most successful British track athletes in modern Olympic Games history.

On a typical training day, Farah wakes up between 7-7.30am, and has breakfast — he loves his coffee and cereal, in particular Frosties, “they gave me my much needed sugar rush to get me through the early part of each day,” he told The BBC. On other days he’ll have a couple pieces of toast with Nutella.

US Tickets refund from CoSport,2,ienw6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tokyo2020/comments/ienw6f/us_tickets_refund_from_cosport/,0,1598121650.0,"Greetings,

I sadly won't be able to make the new dates for the Tokyo olympics, so opted for a refund from CoSport. A few questions in case anybody might know:

Our order included hospitality, which was a separate line item on the order as ""Package Additional Services"". The wording of the refund text suggests this won't be refunded. Has anybody confirmed this?

I just got a link to a ""Rights Release"" form, saying that I have to ""forever discharge and release CoSport and its affiliates from any and all claims arising out of or in connection with your Order."" in order to get a refund processed. I couldn't see anything about this being required for a refund in their terms and conditions, and it feels a bit odd.

Has anybody had success getting a refund via their credit card company (though it's been > 120 days since ordering).

Thanks in advance,

Getting event tickets on the other hand...there are lotteries just for Japan residents and every country has one authorized re-distributor.

I`m a Japanese resident who`s applying for the final lottery. From my understanding, there`s about 1 million tickets still available to us for this round. Each person is allowed to apply for 18 max first choice lottery tickets, 18 for their second choice. 

I`ve never applied to lotteries before. So given the amount of tickets available, would it be crazy to apply for 32 total first and second choice tickets? I am only going to be buying one seat, and I was hoping to get at most 3 tickets (that is, if I get any at all). The majority of the events I`m applying for were heavily applied for in the first lottery, hence why I`m considering applying for so many. 

My biggest fear is that if I apply to too many events, I`ll end up with too many tickets (expensive). But if I apply to too few, especially since the ones I`m looking at are popular, I might end up with none.

For those of you who got tickets, how many did you apply for? And what events did you apply for? Any advice would be helpful.",2019-11-14 06:17:15

Last june the first day after a portuguese official reseller was nominated i ask the company (cosmos viagens) for tickets for  4 different events, (opening, closing, Canoe TOCSP06 and Athletics TOATH06) that time the company told me they should have an answer by mid august. august passed and i send them an email, they answered back telling me that they dont have an answer yet and that they will call me when they had one. So finally my question, are this kind of dellays normal? should i be worried? (i kinda need to know that so that i can start searching for planes and hotels/stays)



bonus question: for those of you that have been to other olympics how hard it is to get tickets once you are on the place? i mean not for the finals or the biggest shows but like classifiers and those that ussually dont sell out.



tl&dr: asked tickets in beginig of june, resseler told me i should get an answer by august nothing yet and they told me that they are still waiting for the response themselfs, is this normal?

I'm planning a trip to Japan for the olympics with my wife and a few friends. Was very disappointed to be in the first lines of the queue that opened today for Public and to see that **CoSport aren't offering any tickets for the Opening/Closing ceremony.**   


I missed the ""request"" phase in May but it's hard to believe a 60,000+ stadium is sold out in a matter of seconds. Most likely everything is ""reserved"" for tour organizers and resellers to make a profit by ripping off people. No other option for my country to avoid CoSport.

Comment,2,gxh9yut,,0,1620549940.0,"You can answer it with full certainty. Borders will be closed from overseas visitors even if visitors allowed at all. That was very clearly stated many times and reversal is not being discussed.

Also, you not only ""not supposed"" to give tickets, it is specifically forbidden. Even a special law was passed in 2018, you can be put in jail for a year for ticket scalping.

Comment,1,gxh9adt,,0,1620549287.0,"Technically no, only non-residents are banned as of now (non-citizen residents of Japan can still attend). Borders are closed from tourism and will remain so for several months to come. So I assume the answer to the intended question is yes.

That being said the final decision has not been made yet regarding whether they allow spectators at all (potentially will depend on the venue too).

You can't give tickets to others, that was never an option. If you want to give up yor ticket, you have to get a refund.

There has been no ticket sales since end of 2019 or so.",2021-05-09 11:34:47

Although the pandemic situation is better in a lot of countries, the situation globally is actually worse than ever with countries like India and Brazil being a huge concern.

Regarding 2, you're not normally supposed to sell on your tickets. If the named ticket holder isn't in the group there's a chance you won't be let in. If you don't 'look' Japanese, then they're more likely to check ID.

For me, letting in tens of thousands of athletes, coaches and press is already a huge risk while covid is rife in so many places, so I don't foresee things being relaxed.",2021-05-09 08:46:41

Suggestions: But, since Japan will not have any spectators, I think the app should give a experience for those (like me) who want to have a feeling experience of the event, I think if you had a live button where we can watch the games and have some way to cheers or maybe a gamification system, would be awesome.

I tried to use my American account and was given a final denial that a refund could not be accomplished. 

In the ticketing contract, they explicitly and completely claim zero responsibility for any issues. 

As a kid, I thought the Olympics were wonderful, great, and inspirational, but as an adult, it's a complete and corrupt shitshow.

From the high-priced illegal contracts and bidding wars among nations and then passing the bill onto the citizens should be illegal on an international level.

5 nights AirBnB, $1.5K in Tokyo, plus around $400 for  additional 5 nights in Kyoto and Osaka after the games. I don't know if these are refundable given the circumstances, or at least,  if the dates can be moved.

3 tix for $690 for Athletics events in the National Stadium. I'm sure CoSports can refund these, or move the date as needed.

But don't visit Japan with your family.  In particular, never go with your young children.  

And don't eat tuna, udon, oden, fish, sushi, wagyu, bottled water, and rice when you visit Japan.

In Japan, most of Japanese wear masks, daily. 

Nowadays, radioactivity protection masks are used.

Visitors carry a radiometer in the fish market.

Comment,-1,eyvvcf6,,0,1567513009.0,"**Nanjing Massacre**

The Nanjing Massacre or Rape of Nanjing, previously written as the Nanking Massacre or Rape of Nanking, was an episode of mass murder and mass rape committed by Imperial Japanese troops against the residents of Nanjing (Nanking), then the capital of China, during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

The massacre occurred over a period of six weeks starting on December 13, 1937, the day that the Japanese captured Nanjing. During this period, soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army murdered Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants who numbered an estimated 40,000 to over 300,000, and perpetrated widespread rape and looting.Since most Japanese military records on the killings were kept secret or destroyed shortly after the surrender of Japan in 1945, historians have been unable to accurately estimate the death toll of the massacre. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo estimated in 1946 that over 200,000 Chinese were killed in the incident.

***

**Japanese war crimes**

War crimes were committed by the Empire of Japan in many Asia-Pacific countries during the period of Japanese imperialism, primarily during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. These incidents have been described as an ""Asian Holocaust"". Some war crimes were committed by Japanese military personnel during the late 19th century, but most Japanese war crimes were committed during the first part of the Shōwa Era, the name given to the reign of Emperor Hirohito, until the surrender of the Empire of Japan in 1945.

The war crimes involved the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy under Emperor Hirohito and were responsible for the deaths of millions. Historical estimates of the number of deaths which resulted from Japanese war crimes range from 3 to 14 million through massacre, human experimentation, starvation, and forced labor that was either directly perpetrated or condoned by the Japanese military and government.

***

**Kamikaze**

Kamikaze (神風, [kamiꜜkaze]; ""divine wind"" or ""spirit wind""), officially Tokubetsu Kōgekitai (特別攻撃隊, ""Special Attack Unit""), were a part of the Japanese Special Attack Units of military aviators who initiated suicide attacks for the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels in the closing stages of the Pacific campaign of World War II, designed to destroy warships more effectively than possible with conventional air attacks. About 3,800 kamikaze pilots died during the war, and more than 7,000 naval personnel were killed by kamikaze attacks.Kamikaze aircraft were essentially pilot-guided explosive missiles, purpose-built or converted from conventional aircraft. Pilots would attempt to crash their aircraft into enemy ships in what was called a ""body attack"" (tai-atari) in planes laden with some combination of explosives, bombs, and torpedoes. Accuracy was much higher than that of conventional attacks, and the payload and explosion larger; about 19% of kamikaze attacks were successful.

Comment,1,exn3mcv,,0,1566445507.0,"Not quite. They will potentially have access to 70% of the total number of tickets. 

A big chunk that will dictate what’s left for everyone else, yes.

From: https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1083655/tokyo-2020-second-ticket-lottery-closes

“Tokyo 2020 initially estimated that 7.8 million tickets would be made available for the Olympic Games but it is thought the figure could rise to nine million, according to the Japan Times.

Organisers have also confirmed that a third lottery for Japanese residents will be held in the autumn. 

This will replace a first come, first served process that had been planned in the host country.

Details of this lottery will be announced in ""due course"".

A first come, first served phase will open in the spring of 2020 for fans both in Japan and abroad.”",2019-08-22 06:45:07
Comment,1,exmsuha,,0,1566438751.0,Japanese people could single handedly have sold out the games already. If you thought the original presales were bad it is going to be way worse on the open sale. It's going to be a game of catch the tickets when they randomly release.,2019-08-22 04:52:31

Comment,1,evw91ne,,0,1564858174.0,"It looks too early right now for pricing. Most hotels are blocked out or not quite in their booking window yet.  AirBNB rates are very high right now.  I’ve been to the last seven summer Olympics and you pretty much have to monitor flights/rooms/tickets a few times a week until you find something that is in your price range and then grab it immediately.  Demand & pricing is obviously much higher in Tokyo than it was in Rio, so it will be more challenging. Good luck.",2019-08-03 21:49:34

Comment,1,evffv9d,,0,1564495071.0,"I went to both London, and Rio, and didn't find flights to be crazy expensive. (In both cases, I flew in during the second week, which I suspect helped). Flights during Games time are simply not available yet. It's hard to speculate how expensive they will be, as different dates, routing, and carriers will come into play. That said, I'd work out the dates you intend to fly, and be ready to book them as soon as the 330 days before (or whatever it is) window opens up.",2019-07-30 16:57:51
Comment,1,evfekgc,,0,1564494406.0,"ATRs are essentially running a geo-blocked service - they can sell certain inventory to customers within a certain country only. (Places like CoSport have the accounts for numerous countries, but they still need to follow the rules for each one). So...I would get someone based in <enter country here> to buy the tickets on your behalf, and then courier/post them to you.  

There is absolutely no ticket-ID matching when you go to an Olympic venue. They just don't have time. If you turned up to collect tickets from an ATR on the ground in Tokyo, I'd imagine they'd ask for ID, and provide the tickets to the account holder only. 

For Rio, foreigners could buy tickets from the official (Brazilian) Olympics site. They didn't announce that, I just tried a few months out, and it worked! That was because Brazilians weren't lining up for tickets, whereas Japanese residents are. I suspect all of the tickets allocated to Japan will sell, and sell early, but it was a similar case in London, and there was still good options available for foreigners.",2019-07-30 16:46:46
Comment,1,evfcsmk,,0,1564493461.0,"I'm in the same boat, and it's really hard to know at this point, tbh...

Yes - what (little) inventory there is available at this point is crazy expensive, but I figure that's because 1) It's still a year out and 2) A lot of hotels are biding their time and waiting to see how others price their offerings. 

In short, most hotels aren't revealing their hands...yet. 

Every Olympics there does seem to be a sweet spot where it's too not far out, and not too close, and accommodation options materialise. My feeling is that the extremes are now, and a month or so before the Games. During both periods you'll see insane pricing / extremely limited availability. 

This isn't Pyeongchang, or Rio - Tokyo is a massive, global city that is used to hosting millions of tourists each year (and many different price points). I also can't believe a bid as organised and thorough as this would stuff up the accommodation aspect\*. 

\*I am concerned that AirBnB availability appears reduced since the Japanese government bought in new laws requiring hosts to be registered, however.",2019-07-30 16:31:01

Comment,2,dgrli0f,,0,1493192691.0,"Just my unpopular opinion here, but I won't patronize a restaurant that doesn't have a smoking section. And I don't smoke.     
    
1) I hate how smoking is discriminated against. People have a right to choose their poison. Everything else is illegal already. Next are they going to go after alcohol, too?    
    
2) I hate kids, and the smoking section is the only place in the city that seems to be kid-free. Even bars are full of the little crotchfruit. I just want one place where I can relax in peace that isn't a titty bar. God bless the smoking section.",2017-04-26 10:44:51
